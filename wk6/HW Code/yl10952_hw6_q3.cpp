Hw6 Q3
Question 3:
The number e is an important mathematical constant that is the base of the natural logarithm. e
        also arises in the study of compound interest, and in many other applications.
Background of e: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)
e can be calculated as the sum of the infinite series:
  e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3!+...
The value of e is approximately equal to 2.71828. We can get an approximate value of e, by
calculating only a partial sum of the infinite sum above (the more addends we add, the better
        approximation we get).
Implement the function:
double eApprox(int n)
This function is given a positive integer n, and returns an approximation of e, calculated by the
sum of the first (n+1) addends of the infinite sum above.
To test your function use the following main:
int main() {
    cout.precision(30);
    for (int n = 1; n <= 15; n++) {
        cout<<"n = "<<n<<'\t'<<eApprox(n)<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

Notes:
1. Pay attention to the running time of eApprox. An efficient implementation would run in
Î˜(n).
2. Since the values of the factorials will grow to be very large, use a variable of type double
        to store them.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

double eApprox(int n){
    double e = 1.0;
    double fac = 1.0;

    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        fac *= i;
        e += 1/fac;
    }

    return e;
}

//double eApprox(int n);
//double factorial(int f);//values of factorials grow large, use double to store them

int main() {
    cout.precision(30);

    for (int n = 1; n <= 15; n++) {
        cout<<"n = "<<n<<'\t'<<eApprox(n)<<endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
